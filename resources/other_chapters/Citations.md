## Citations

You can generally follow the [Bookdown instructions about citations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html), but you don't need to add the additional bibliography argument at the top of the Rmds.

To add a new reference source, add to the `book.bib` file, keeping your new entry in alphabetical order.

For articles (or anything with a DOI), go to [doi2bib.org](https://www.doi2bib.org/) or [ZoteroBib](https://zbib.org/) to get a BibTex-formatted reference that you can copy and paste the reference to the `book.bib` file.

You can also use programs like Zotero or Endnote to export a .bib file and either combine with the `book.bib` or manage your references from there.

Other sources can be added using this template:
```
@website{citekey,
    author = {First Last},
    title = {Title},
    url  = {http://www.someurl.html},
}
```

To reference the citations in your writing follow the [bookdown instructions](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html):

```
Items can be cited directly within the documentation using the syntax @key where key is the citation key in the first line of the entry, e.g., @R-base. To put citations in parentheses, use [@key]. To cite multiple entries, separate the keys by semicolons, e.g., [@key-1; @key-2; @key-3]. To suppress the mention of the author, add a minus sign before @, e.g., [-@R-base].
```

See [Chapter 2](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/blob/main/02-chapter_of_course.Rmd) of this template course for examples.
