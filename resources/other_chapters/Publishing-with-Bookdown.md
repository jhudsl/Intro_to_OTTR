Bookdown is published using Github pages which you can set up [following the set up repository instructions](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Starting-a-new-course-with-this-template#set-up-github-pages).

As you modify the names of the chapters of your course and add more chapters (using the `.Rmd` files), you need to update the `_bookdown.yml` file accordingly.

For example let's say that we added another chapter and named the file `03-new_chapter_of_course.Rmd`.
We would update our `_bookdown.yml` to look like this:

```yaml
book_filename: "Course_Name"  
chapter_name: "Chapter "  
repo: https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/ ##Make sure you update this for your GitHub Repo!!  
rmd_files: ["index.Rmd",  
            "01-intro.Rmd",   
            "02-chapter_of_course.Rmd",   
            "03-new_chapter_of_course.Rmd",  ##Only this is new!
            "about.Rmd"]  
new_session: yes  
delete_merged_file: true  
language:  
  ui:  
    chapter_name: "Chapter "  
output_dir: "docs"  
```

Notice how only one line is different - the one that says `03-chapter_of_course.Rmd",`
Be careful about quotation marks: `""` as well as commas: `,`!

Once we do this we can preview the book!

You can do so by typing:
`bookdown::serve_book()` in the RStudio Console.  

Note that when you run `bookdown` it will create an `.rds` file; you can generally ignore this file.

You will then see a live version of your book in your RStudio viewer.

Note that When a pull request is merged to main, `bookdown::render_book()` will be re-run by the [GitHub actions](#github-actions) and the results added to `main`.
