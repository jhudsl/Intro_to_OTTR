# How to contribute to [ITN](https://www.itcrtraining.org/) courses

## Reviewing existing content

There is a lot of course content we are creating that we could use help reviewing and editing. If you would like to share your suggestions for a particular course, whether it be suggestions about reconfiguring content, editing wording, or identifying typos, we would greatly appreciate your help!

1. Go to our [course list page](https://www.itcrtraining.org/courses) and click on `Source Materials` for the course you are interested in reviewing.
2. This will bring you to the course's GitHub.
3. Scroll down to take a look at the course's README.md file to get a general idea of the scope and goals of the course.
4. You may want to take a look at the rendered version of the material as you are looking at the course. This should be linked in the README.
5. Check if there are an existing open pull requests (that are NOT labeled with `sync`).

## There are open pull requests
6. If there are open pull requests (not counting any that are labeled with `sync`) you can [add yourself as a reviewer](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).
