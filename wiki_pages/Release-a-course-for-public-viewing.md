# Release a course for public viewing

Congrats, you are most of the way toward publishing your course!

At this point, it is a good idea to [create a release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)! (It's a good idea to [set up Google Analytics](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Google-Analytics) before completing this step)

For `jhudsl` courses your release tag signifies your course's readiness for public viewing (and whether or not it will be added to the public version of the [JHU course library](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14KYZA2K3J78mHVCiWV6-vkY6it37Ndxnow1Uu7nMa80/edit#gid=0).

### Release coding
- Releases that are 1.0 or greater are considered ready for public viewing.
- Releases less than 1.0 will be considered "on deck". They will be advertised to learners as nearly ready, but will have a warning that lets them know the course is still actively under development.
- No release tags means the course is not ready for public listing or viewing at this time.
