# Leanpub conversion tips

To allow for easy conversion to Leanpub, we suggest the following:

1) When making a list of points, if you make each major heading a separate line, this can avoid numbering issues. This also works better typically then using a bulleted list unless the list items are short (less than one line).

Here you can see how this list in bookdown made a nice list in Leanpub.

Here is the Bookdown version:

Here is the Leanpub version:

2) Avoid images between numeric list items.
3) For making empty lines use `&nbsp;` as it is compatible with Leanpub.
