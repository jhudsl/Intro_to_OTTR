# Fixing errors and bugs

If you've identify a bug or problem with a course we are appreciative of your help! We ask that you file an issue describing the bug you've found.

Note that if you do not have a GitHub account, GitHub will request that you create one. (It is free).

## How to file an issue about a bug
1. Go to our [course list page](https://www.itcrtraining.org/courses) and click on `Source Materials` for the course you've found a bug or problem with.
2. This will bring you to the course's GitHub.
3. Click on `Issues` and then `New Issue`.
4. Choose `Course Problem Report`.
5. Answer the prompts with as much description as you can provide!

Thank you for your help!
