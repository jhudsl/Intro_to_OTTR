# Proposing New Content

If you would like to propose new content for a particular course we are appreciative of your suggestions! You could possibly contribute a paragraph, section, or chapter. We ask that you file your idea for new content by [filing a GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). This allows us to confirm your plan before you get started.

Note that if you do not have a GitHub account, GitHub will request that you create one. (It is free).

## How to propose new content
1. Go to our [course list page](https://www.itcrtraining.org/courses) and click on `Source Materials` for the course you are interested in reviewing.
2. This will bring you to the course's GitHub.
3. Click on `Issues` and then `New Issue`.
4. Choose `New content idea`.
5. Answer the prompts.

Thank you for contributing your ideas!
